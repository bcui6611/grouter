grouter - next-gen memcached/couchbase protocol router
======================================================

Instead of "hello world", I write proxy/routers when trying out a new
language.  With grouter, I can also play with design ideas for a moxi
"2.0", but learn golang at the same time.

    git clone git://github.com/steveyen/grouter.git
    cd grouter
    export GOPATH=`pwd`
    go install ./src/grouter
